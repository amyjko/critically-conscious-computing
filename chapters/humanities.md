While most of this book has ostensibly been about computer science, it has also intersected many other disciplines, including mathematics, philosophy, design, information, and numerous social sciences, especially history. But underlying all of these intersecting critical questions about computing has been one overarching concern: what does computing mean for humanity and what _should_ it mean?

This question is not far from central questions in humanities: What does it mean to be human? What is society? How is humanity changing? How is it the same? Before computing, these questions frequently engaged questions of other technologies. Plato, as we noted earlier in our chapter on [CS, Equity, and Justice|justice], even argued against writing as a technology, as it might rob us of our memories:

"
What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only the semblance of wisdom, for by telling them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to know much while for the most part they know nothing
" Plato, Phaedrus

Like Plato, philosophers, historians, anthropologists, linguists, lawyers, and political scientists have long grappled with the duality between the human condition and our propensity to try to change it through technology.

But it is reasonable to wonder if computing and the humanities intersect in more meaningful ways. After all, much of this book has been decidedly technical, discussing the logic of instructions, the storage of data, the notations of algorithms, and the engineering skills needed to leverage these concepts to build practical artifacts that change the world (for better or worse). What could this possibly have to do with the humanities, which is far more concerned with interpreting the past, conceptualizing reason, interrogating humanity’s relationship to beauty, fate, loss, hate, conflict and emotions that drive and follow these human experiences? To many computer scientists, these ideas have little to no role to play in making machine learning work, solving a challenging constraint problem, or scaling a web service. And to most in the humanities, computers might be seen as nothing more than a tool for reading and writing, and perhaps a less than ideal one.

Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that the intersections between computing and the humanities are abundant. Computing liberally borrows metaphors from language, writing, and linguistics; humanities, through both fiction and nonfiction, have never been more engaged (and skeptical) of how computing is changing humanity, culture, and communities. And some of the most central concerns in this book -- those of equality, equity, justice, and the role of computing in obstructing or achieving these goals -- fundamentally emerge from the humanities and social sciences and their critical, historical, and sometimes speculative way of examining computing.

While this intersection has been present throughout this book, we’ve primarily approached it through the lens of computing as a discipline. For example, our questions were what does ethics have to say about Boolean truth values, not what do Boolean truth values have to say about ethics? Thus, in this chapter, we will instead center the humanities and social sciences, examine what role computing is playing in them, and how these intersections might be brought into secondary humanities classrooms.

# Intersections

Across the humanities, there are generally two roles that computing has played: 1) as a tool of the humanities and social sciences, amplifying its core activities, and 2) as a subject of the humanities and social sciences, a phenomena to be analyzed, discussed, and critiqued. We’ll examine the numerous ways in which specific disciplines have intersected in these ways.

## Literature

One of the more prominent humanities disciplines is Literature (often falling under English requirements in western secondary education). Literature is broadly concerned with all written, spoken, or even sung works of language art, including fiction, non-fiction, poetry, plays, and the many aesthetic and narrative concerns that arise in particular genres, including arguments, stories, and emotions. The [Common Core|http://www.corestandards.org] initiative in the United States, for example, conceptualizes literature as involving reading comprehension skills such as literacy, interpretation, analysis, synthesis, and critique. In practice, it also involves engaging literary canon -- great works from history, often those of historical significance, or ones that have something to teach students about humanity, society, and human values.

As framed above, computing does not have much to say directly about literature or the skills involved in reading and appreciating it. And yet, as computing has become ubiquitous, both as a daily tool of life, but also a center of power, it has quickly crept its way into literature in surprising ways.

|Chapter20_Image_Scanner_Darkly.png|An illustrated Keanu Reeves wearing a headset in Scanner Darkly|Philip K. Dick’s A Scanner Darkly adapted into illustrated film, examines drugs, police surveillance, privacy, and paranoia.|Warner Independent Pictures|>

Perhaps the most obvious way is as a subject of literature. Science fiction, for example, is a genre in literature that has long examined our relationships to technology. Shelly’s Frankenstein<shelley18> for example, can be seen as a philosophical examination of the nature of intelligence and whether artificial intelligence like the book’s nameless monster has a soul. Isaac Asimov’s classics, I, Robot<asimov50> examines the challenges of ethical reasoning through logic in the context of robotics, and his series Foundation<asimov42> as an examination of using mathematics and computation to predict the course of society over centuries. Philip K. Dick’s A Scanner Darkly<dick77> examines human identity through augmented reality and addiction. William Gibson’s Neuromancer<gibson84> considers what it means to be connected (and disconnected) from virtual worlds. And Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash<stephenson92> skeptically illustrates a world of social networks, cryptocurrency, geosurveillance, and virtual reality.

These works are not stereotypical dimestore schlock, but careful, often epic social critiques of how ideas in computing are changing society and the human condition. And in unintended ways, they have also become an ironic roadmap for technologists ignorant of social impact. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, for example, took Stephenson’s idea of the metaverse literally, pursuing a vision of living fully in virtual worlds that the writer meant to deter. And much of the progress on speech interfaces in computer science was inspired by the voice assistants portrayed in the utopian Star Trek universe. Reading these works, therefore, is not purely about entertainment (though they are entertaining), but also an exercise in critically examining our present relationships to computing.

Of course, some literature makes these social critiques directly. Many of the non-fiction works we have cited throughout this book offer careful and direct social critiques of computing. Ruha Benjamin’s _Race After Technology_<benjamin19> for example, draws a direct line between the evolution of slavery to Jim Crow laws to algorithmic racial bias. Virginia Eubank’s _Automating Inequality_<eubanks18> considers algorithmic systems situated in social safety nets and how they are often used as a way to deny help, rather than grow it. These authors’ arguments draw upon history, human values, and social critique to counterbalance the often unquestioned and decontextualized optimism of technologists.

While computing has never been more present in literature, it has also played an increasing role in the scholarship of literature through the emerging practice of ~digital humanities~digitalhumanities. Computers are increasingly used to help carefully archive rare texts to preserve literature, to enable the analysis of large collections of literature to understand the evolution of language in writing, to empower independent publishing, and to grow access to literature. Entire subcultures of literature now also exist outside traditional publishers and humanities scholarship, including online [fanfiction|https://archiveofourown.org] communities, in which fans of literature (often youth) gather to discuss it, analyze it, and even write new literature situated in worlds first imagined by other authors. Even this book, self-published on the internet, embraces the internet as a medium for long-form non-fiction. Computing, therefore, while often a subject of criticism when written about, is also a tool for gathering, sharing, bonding, and creating around literature.

## History

While literature is often about history or examines history, it is often in service of narrative or argument. In contrast, the discipline of history chronicles the events of human history directly, trying to understand what happened, why, and what it means for our present and future. The discipline spans many activities, including not only archiving knowledge about history, but organizing it, interpreting it, and analyzing it for cause and effect, sometimes for the inherent value of understanding it, but sometimes for the practical value of revealing perspectives on our present and future.

On the surface, computing might seem to be entirely opposite to history. Computing is most often concerned with the future, it regularly discards previous technologies, and many of the people with power who create the computational platforms that increasingly drive our lives seem to see the world ahistorically. But as we’ve discussed throughout this book, computing is inseparable from history: the field’s ideas have roots from centuries old scholars and the field’s chief problems of computation have always been central in human civilization.

|Chapter20_Image_William_Murrell.jpg|A black and white photo of a Black man in front of a computer on the phone.|Black Software tells the story of Black entrepreneurs such as William Murrell, President of Metroserve Computer Corporation, who helped explore the early internet, while at the same time, computing was being weaponized by IBM to police and incarcerate Black communities.|Courtesy of William Murrell|<

It is not surprising, then, that computing has been a subject of history. For example, Charles McIlwain in his book _Black Software_, <mcilwain19>, captures much of the recent history from the 1970’s to today of Black Americans’ early entrepreneurship in the computing industry and the often countervailing forces of anti-Black government initiatives to surveil and police Black people with computing. James Gleick, in his book _The Information_ <gleick11>, considers the slightly earlier period of the 1940’s and 50’s examining the work of Alan Turing and Claude Shannon in setting the foundations for digital algorithms and data, but sets the stage with prehistoric systems of digital communication with smoke signals. Thus, works like these do not merely capture and retell the recent stories of computing history, but situate it in the much longer histories that led to computing, while also helping us understand why we have the digital world we have today -- and why we don’t have the many different ones that were proposed and abandoned.

However, just as literature has appropriated computing to support reading and publishing, historians have found powerful new ways to approach history scholarship with computing. They have collaborated with computer scientists to decode ancient languages <park20>, applied machine learning to restoring artifacts and identifying objects in photographs and art <maaten07>, and find associations between digitized historical artifacts in seconds that might have taken historians decades to notice <bukhari12>. Thus, while some historians are viewing computing as a one of many new topics in history to examine, others are viewing it as a transformative tool that is reshaping how history is chronicled, captured, and analyzed.

## Social Sciences

The Social Sciences often have a complicated relationship to the humanities. Anthropology, Communication, Economics, Education, Geography, Law, Politics, Psychology, Sociology—these are disciplines that are very much concerned with the same questions as the humanities (_What does it mean to be human? What is society?_), but rather than using methods of interpretation, analysis, and argumentation, instead rely on the methods of science. Thus, while a literature scholar might approach the question of artificial intelligence from an analytical lens, a psychologist might approach it experimentally in the lab and a communication researcher might empirically analyze dialogue between a human and a chat bot. Even the two humanities disciplines we have discussed so far -- literature and history -- can be seen as social sciences, especially as they have begun to use computing as tools to gather and analyze data using methods of science.{We include humanities and social sciences in this chapter together not to equate them to the humanities, but rather to center both the humanities and social sciences interest in humanity, and de-emphasize their methodological distinctions.}

Because of this shared interest, the humanities and social sciences have similar relationships to computing. Many social sciences have engaged computing as a subject of study, scientifically examining how computing is shaping society and how society is shaping computing. And as computing has become a powerful tool for data collection and analysis, it has also begun to reshape each social science in new ways, as often happens when a science embraces a new form of scientific instrument.

|Chapter20_Image_Game_Boy.jpg|An Asian man walks by a large Game Boy display advertising the system in a store.|The Game Boy was more than entertainment; it shaped our global relationship to portable computing, gaming, and play.|Yoshikazu Tsuno, Getty Images|>

*Anthropology* illustrates one example of this dual relationship. As a discipline concerned with the study of culture, computing has generated an immense amount of interest amongst anthropologists. Questions abound:

* How has the shift from centralized, scheduled television programming on broadcast channels to decentralized, paywalled, always-available streaming services changed pop culture? 
* Have computers expanded literacy or dampened it? 
* Is the internet changing human values? 
* What is distinct about Internet culture and humor from historical culture, if anything, and why? 

Culture always changes, but to anthropologists, it has never changed faster, and computing may be one of the reasons why. Answering these questions, of course, increasingly involves using computing to gather and analyze data about people’s use of computers.

One aspect of culture is *Communication*, a discipline broadly concerned with how people form relationships, exchange information, and organize. Whereas much of the history of the discipline concerned face-to-face communication, it also long considered technology-mediated communication, such as through telephones and television. But computing, now having mediated much of human communication, is now a central topic in communication, raising many new questions:

* How does talking to people through computers change our relationships? 
* What is the effect of particular media affordances on what kinds of communication are possible? 
* What kinds of bonds are and are not possible to form through computer mediated communication? 

Books such as Sherry Turkle’s _Alone Together_ <turkle11> have examined some of these questions in the context of youth communication, finding surprising deficits in face-to-face smalltalk skills, replaced by much more robust skills in asynchronous banter.

Whereas Anthropology is concerned with culture, *Psychology* (also called Behavioral Sciences, more generally) are concerned with the mind. Computing initially played a metaphorical role in shaping theories of cognition. For example, before computing, psychologists often used mechanical metaphors to imagine how consciousness and reason worked, even analogizing the structures in our brain to steam and gears. But with the advent of computing, theories began to describe the human mind as an “information processing” machine, much like the CPU of a computer. This was not meant literally, and we now know it to be far from accurate, but it has been a productive metaphor for revealing precisely how human cognition and computation are distinct. For example, whereas computer memory is persistent, reliable, and precise, human memory is highly fallible, constantly reconfigured, and highly interpreted. And of course, these emerging insights about the mind have increasingly been thanks partly to advances in computation: psychologists increasingly rely on computers to run experiments, scan brains, conduct statistical analyses on data.

If Anthropology is concerned with culture, *Sociology* is concerned with the systems and structures that produce culture, including social class, social stratification, social change, and systems of social relationships, including law, identity, religion, and institutions. As computing has come to play a role in all of these aspects of society, sociology has begun to examine its effects. For example, sociologists have long studied the ~digital divide~digitaldivide, a phrase that captures the complex effects of disparate access to computers, the internet, and information amongst people in different social classes. Sociologists have studied the impact of the internet on wellness <kraut98>, examining the extent to which it changes the quantity and quality of our friendships. And sociologists have increasingly considered computing platforms such as social media sites as a new form of institution, one with its own culture, laws, and norms that interact with broader society (e.g., the role of social media in organizing and fomenting the January 6th, 2020 insurrection on the U.S. capital). As with all social sciences, computing, code, and data have become central tools for examining all of these phenomena.

|Chapter20_Image_Bitcoin.jpg|A colorful angle shot of a conference full of people listening to panelists.|A cryptocurrency conference captivates thousands of speculators, investors, and entrepreneurs, excited by the potential of a new data structure.|Ian Witlen for The Rolling Stone|<

Whereas Sociology is concerned with the largest of social systems, Economics is broadly concerned with the production and distribution of goods and services through these social systems, especially from the perspective of markets and the individual actors in them. While computing has had the same transformative impacts on the discipline as a tool of science—enabling economists to gather more data than ever and conduct ever more elaborate analyses and experiments -- computing has also reshaped what economists study. For example, the history of economic theory about markets has been situated within the constraints of the physical world. Do these properties hold in digital marketplaces, which offer often unregulated digital currencies, infinite resources, highly dynamic shifts in culture and norms about behavior, and unpredictable interactions with the physical world? And while economists have long considered the up and downsides of globalization through physical means, the way the internet has digitally connected the world is raising new questions about the intersection between trade and law. For example, if someone designs a product for printing with a 3D printer, posts it online, and someone in a different country downloads and prints it, was it in an imported good? These questions ultimately derive from the shift from information as an often physically embodied good with resource and mobility constraints to a digital good, with none of these constraints.

All of the questions raised in the humanities and social sciences pose great challenges for how to organize conflicting preferences amongst people in society. This is the core concern of *Political Science*, which examines governance, power, law, and advocacy. Computing has raised several new questions for politics. For example, should we regulate computing and if so, how? Is social media ultimately a net benefit to democracy and political organizing or a threat to it? And how might democratic institutions and processes need to adapt to both the opportunities of digital engagement voting, but also the security threats posed by it? The humanities parts of political science thinks critically about the tradeoffs of different ways of weaving computing into politics; the social science part examines the empirically observable effects of the weaving that has already happened.

## Philosophy

Underlying all of the humanities and social sciences—and arguably all scholarly disciplines—is Philosophy, engaging the biggest questions of all:

* What is knowledge?
* What is reason?
* What is truth?
* What is morality? 
* What is fault? 
* What is good? 

The typically pragmatic concerns of computing might not seem to have anything to do with these grand questions, but as we have shown throughout this book, even the most mundane choices in designing computer behavior can have deeply consequential moral, ethical, and epistemological consequences on reality. Computing has therefore challenged philosophy with many new questions. For example, what is _privacy_, in a world in which everyone’s online activities are observable? What is _intelligence_, when many of the independent actors in our digital worlds are artificial? What is _blame_, when many of the computational systems that do harm in the world act independently, but also under the explicit guidance of designers and engineers who purposefully created those systems’ behaviors? What is _identity_, when who we are is not only how we see ourselves and how we are seen, but how we project disembodied selves in virtual spaces? And what is _truth_, when entire fictional worlds of conspiracy theories can be constructed online, directly shaping the values, beliefs, and actions of people in the world? Some philosophers have used computing as a leverage point to examine these fundamental questions (e.g., <brey09, moore08>); others have seen computing as an inherently new and disruptive phenomena that destabilizes some of our most basic views on being (e.g., <floridi02>).

## Criticality and Computing

The humanities and social sciences are the origin of the criticality in this book. These are the fields that question the status quo, but also progress, critiquing the arguments and actions of those in power, and giving us language and ideas to help understand social change. Computing is just one of many subjects of critique in these fields, and only a recent one, as its cultural significance has expanded.

But humanities and social sciences have also traditionally been reluctant adopters of technology. Perhaps this stems from skepticism; perhaps it also stems from the same kinds of disinterest and low self-efficacy that deter youth from studying computing. While this is not inherently problematic -- not every facet of the world needs to be computational -- it has meant that many in humanities and social sciences have overlooked and even discounted the importance of computing in the world and in their own disciplines. We can hope that as these fields are beginning to recognize just how much computing is changing the world that humanities and social science scholars will be at the forefront of helping us imagine and demand a computational world that is more humane than the one we have created so far.

# Teaching Humanities and Social Sciences through Computing

Of all possible integration opportunities, those in the humanities and social sciences are perhaps the least explored in research. Part of this may be due to the overarching resistance to technology in many humanities and social science disciplines; areas like digital humanities and cultural analytics, which apply computing to understanding literature, society, history, and culture, for example, struggle with limitations of computing and the broader lack of critical perspectives within the computing tools often applied to humanities <kirschenbaum2016>. And at the same time, the more traditionally scientific social science disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and economics, have long embraced data and computational tools for analyzing it, but such subject areas are often peripheral in secondary education, crowded out by more traditional humanities topics such as history and English. The result is that opportunities for integration either face resistance or a lack of capacity. 

But such underlying trends are shifting. For example, one work that has explored digital humanities<chen19>: a middle-school after school camp that engaged cultural analytics. The camp struggled to recruit, students largely wanted to use tools to tell stories and create games, but the effort suggested potential as a pathway to engaging communities disinterested in dominant CS pedagogy. Other work has begun to explore intersections between history and computing<guzdial22>, helping history teachers engage youth in tracking population shifts and their relationships to major world events.

Other scholars have explored intersections around sociocultural dimensions of computing, while also embracing making. One major approach to this has been to focus on culture in social studies settings, not only as a subject of intellectual inquiry, but also as an asset that students bring to share and sustain through critical making. For example, researchers Michael Lachney and Ron Eglash have done a series of studies investigating ways of engaging culture and computing:

* Designing curricula that use Python to engage in culturally authentic making such as quilting, braiding, science fiction, and art<davis19>;
* Engaging indigenous and non-indigenous youth in recreating symbols and history from indigenous communities to as a form of material agency<eglash20a,eglash20b>;
* Building upon cultural capital in cosmetology and braiding in Black communities<lachney17a,lachney19>;
* Linking classroom activities with community-based social movements.<lachney17b>

These examples simultaneously engage the culturally responsive and sustaining principles we discussed at the beginning of this book, while also meaningfully engaging youth in inquiry about a diversity of cultures.

In contrast to the data-centered and culture-centered approaches above, other scholars have begun to examine computing as a lens for examining social justice. For example, one project engaged youth in VR environments that encouraged youth to playfully question gender and sexuality by designing avatars that challenged gender and sex binaries<paré19>, as scholars in gender studies have long examined through more analytical means. Others have used data not as a tool for examining humanity and society, but as something to critically question, interrogating its role in power, authority, and equity<irgens20>. Some projects have explored the capacity of classrooms as places to develop critical consciousness about technology and power, finding challenging ties between teacher identity, school culture, and trust<everson22>. Others have begun to use stories, narratives, and scenarios about AI as a lens through which to examine ethics, technology, and society<forsyth21>. These explorations demonstrate that many youth can and do want to discuss issues of fairness and justice in class and find computing a powerful lens through which to discuss them.

While recent work shows student desire to discuss computing and society, it also shows teacher resistance and reluctance. Some research has found that when computing is directly linked to existing topics, many teachers easily embrace integrations; others, however, struggle to link vague ideas like abstraction and computational thinking to the concrete concepts and skills in their humanities and social science classrooms<dong19>. Research on teacher professional development has also found that many teachers, even those in humanities and social sciences, bring a “colorblind” lens to culturally responsive teaching<goode18>, evading and deflecting race-explicit discourse about computing to the detriment of learning about both computing and culture. Long-term professional development appears to be key to overcoming white resistance to teaching about race, culture, ethnicity in the context of CS<goode20>; teachers who are Black, Indigenous, or of color are less likely to resist such teaching and more likely to embrace racially and culturally and inclusive teaching practices<ivey21>.

## Unit Sketch: Engaging Philosophy through Computing

While research integrating computing into humanities and social sciences education is emerging, it is rich. These are disciplines that examine some of the most salient questions of adolescent experiences, such as "_who am I?_", "_who am I in relation to other people?_", "_what do we deserve?_" Examining these questions in humanities in social sciences is already essential work in schools, and the explorations thus far have shown how computing can be a medium in which to explore these questions and express youth’s answers to them.

One integration less explored, however, are the ways that computing challenges long-standing ideas in philosophy. For example, philosophers have long engaged the question “what is knowledge” through the field of epistemology. This question might seem exceptionally abstract for secondary education -- and for most of the history of philosophy, it probably was, as it largely impacted how scientists and scholars came to see discovery. But over the past several decades, computing has made this question of “what is knowledge” far more silent to adolescents, and thus something urgent to examine. Consider, for example, how most adolescents report getting their news secondhand through social media, or how they pursue advice on their medical and physical health through peers rather than parents or healthcare professionals. The restructuring of access to information has dramatically changed how youth come to know, and everyone, youth included, aren’t so sure what that means for expertise, authority, credibility, and learning.

This unit sketch offers one possible way to orchestrate discussions about this topic. It’s learning objectives are:

* Develop arguments about knowledge using computing examples
* Articulate a personal view of credibility through critical examination of computing
* Define and distinguish objectivity and subjectivity through the lens of the Internet

The unit begins by engaging students in examining their own encounters with knowledge.

=
### Session 1: Cite your sources
* Begin by talking about the role of the internet in students lives’, opening a discussion about what kinds of sources students most frequently pursue to learn about what’s happening in the world. Write their sources down in a shared space for everyone to see.
* Pivot the discussion to which of these sources they trust. Do they trust them for every topic or just particular topics? How did they come to trust them? Annotate the sources according to different levels of trust.
* Pivot the discussion to sources that they do not read (most likely “adult” sources, like newspapers, research articles, books in libraries). Why do they not read them? Do they trust them? Capture them in a separate list and annotate them with qualities that deter students from reading them.
* *Formative assessment*. Close the discussion by posting a short writing reflection question: "_If you were trying to ensure that your sources were grounded in expertise, truth, and knowledge, which sources do you think would be best and why? If you don’t read them, why do you not? And if you do, how did you come to start reading them?_" Have students write for 15 minutes, and then see if anyone wants to share their reflections.
** This is _responsive_ because it centers students’ practical relationship to truth and credibility.
** This is _participatory_ because it preserves students’ agency in deciding what and whether to share.
** This is _educative_ because it will help them reflectively analyze their reading practices and their values around different sources.
* Provide a short overview of the forthcoming sessions.
=

This session starts with one of the most salient parts of student lives: their time online, engaging with media, to see what’s new. It brings their world into the classroom for interrogation, asking them to reflect on their own habits and each others’, opening conversations about whether they believe their habits are good.

The next session dives deeper into one trusted source to examine its credibility.

=
### Session 2: Convince me
* Return the group to the list of widely read sources and come to a consensus on one source to examine more closely.
* Explain that the goal of this next exercise is to research this source, but skeptically: who creates it content? What incentivizes them to create its content? What expertise do they have? Reaffirm that the goal is not necessarily to prove that the source is untrustworthy, but rather to evaluate how trustworthy it is.
* Organize students into small groups and have them do research on the source. Ask students to focus on these questions:
** Who creates the content?
** What expertise do they have?
** Who pays for the content?
** What practices do they follow to ensure that the information they share is correct?
* After a period of research, regroup and begin to solicit the key discoveries from their research, recording them in a shared space.
* After synthesizing their discoveries, ask students to privately write an answer to the question "_Is the source trustworthy? Why or why not?_"
* Ask the students to divide into two sides in a philosophical chairs format, one side that believes the source is trustworthy, the other that believes it is not. Facilitate a debate about the sources trustworthiness.
* After the debate, ask students: will they keep reading the source? Why or why not?
=

This second session challenges students to think critically about their sources, examining why they trust them and reconsidering whether they should. This isn’t necessarily to get them to abandon the source, but to critically assess why they think the source is credible. This next session then contrasts this with a source that is perceived to be credible by adults.

=
### Session 3: Read me
* Return the group to the list of sources not widely read by students and come to a consensus on one source to examine more closely.
* Repeat the exercise from the previous session, asking students to research the source’s credibility.
* Repeat the debate on trustworthiness.
* After the debate, ask students: will they start reading the source? Why or why not?
=

After these two deeper analyses of source credibility, the next session engages students in a deeper philosophical discussion: who gets to claim credibility?

=
### Session 4: Who knows?
* Recap the two discussions from the previous sessions, identifying the various factors that led students to trust a source, versus read a source.
* *Summative assessment*. Organize students into small groups of 2-3 and charge them with developing a theory of credible sources. Who should be trusted? What factors should determine credibility? How should these factors be communicated? Should credibility be a factor in what information is shared on the internet? Students should ultimately present their theory and how it would work online; discuss the different options for presenting, co-constructing a set of possible forms and how they will be evaluated.
** This is _responsive_ because it positions students as experts on their relationship to credibility.
** This is _participatory_ because it engages students in shaping how they will communicate their ideas and how that communication will be evaluated.
** This is _educative_ because it will students concretely examine and envision guardrails around misinformation online.
* While students work, rotate between groups, listening and asking critical questions about their ideas, scaffolding synthesis, and helping establish rapport between students who are having trouble collaborating.
* Regroup and ask students about their progress in envisioning credibility online.
=

The next session builds upon the group work and begins to scaffold student presentations:

=
### Session 5: A credible case
* Return students to their small groups to finalize their vision and prepare their presentations.
* Scaffold presentation planning by offering a presentation structure:
** Define credibility
** Explain how credibility would be conveyed online, giving an example
* Have groups present their definitions and visions
* Reflect as a class: how would these visions change the internet? How would they change students’ own personal experiences with the internet?
=

The unit sketch above spans many humanities and social science perspectives, centering on knowledge and credibility, but examining it from an analytical and a design lens. It also aspires to do this in culturally responsive ways, always focusing on students' own perspectives and experiences with the Internet, rather than imposing the teachers’ own perspectives on credibility. That is not to say teachers can’t share them -- students are often especially interested in their teacher’s opinions, but the unit positions them as a supplement to student views, so there is space for students to arrive at their own conclusions and envision their own futures.

Importantly, this sketch also centers humanities and social sciences over computing. There is no programming or discussion of algorithms, though code and algorithms will be an inevitable part of the discussions, since students’ research necessarily has to engage how recommendation algorithms shape what they read and determine who gets paid and how much, via advertising revenue. But this integration, like the others surveyed earlier, lets computing emerge organically into the conversation. This is in contrast to many of the unit sketches earlier in this book, which place computing at the center of the discussion, and bring social science and humanities questions in.

# Conclusion: seeing humanity through digital eyes

Ultimately, there is nothing essential about learning the humanities and social sciences through a computational lens. It can be a powerful way to connect with students and examine the many ways in which society has digitized, but so can other ways of thinking about people and their behavior, whether talking about humanity through music, television, food, identity, or other shared experiences can bring students together. The choice to engage these topics through computing is therefore just one of many ways to engage youth.

That said, computing is increasingly unignorable. As people embrace digital forms of communication and even digital forms of thinking ever more, and society restructures itself around digital commerce, digital decisions, and digital values, the humanities and social sciences are going to play an essential role in resisting digitalization that is dehumanizing, destabilizing, and destructive. As these disciplines began to engage computing more directly and more critically, it may be that teaching the humanities and social sciences also means teaching computing, as they may become inseparable. Secondary educators can be at the forefront of exploring how to engage youth in navigating these shifts, scientifically, humanistically, and critically.
