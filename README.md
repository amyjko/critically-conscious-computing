# Criticially Conscious Computing: Methods for Secondary Education

This book is a collaborative effort at the University of Washington to prepare pre-service secondary educators to teach CS in critically conscious ways. The book is built with [Peruse](https://github.com/amyjko/peruse), a simple framework for authoring online books. It's a living document, and a community effort, and so please submit issues, pull requests, or other feedback!

You can find the book at [criticallyconsciouscomputing.org](https://criticallyconsciouscomputing.org).

The book is currently maintained by Amy Ko, a professor at the University of Washington Information School.
