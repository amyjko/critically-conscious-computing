### _Key Ideas_
* CS emerged from the invention of numbers, manual algorithms for arithmetic calculations, and tools to accelerate these calculations.

* The digital computer created demand for knowledge of CS, which displaced informal CS learning in workplaces with higher education degrees, pursued primarily by non-disabled White and Asian men.

* Early attempts to bring CS to schools put misplaced attention on computers alone, failing to imagine how teachers might facilitate youth to use computers and CS to learn.

* The most recent CS education reform efforts focus on broadening participation, examining and removing structural barriers to CS learning such as resources, policy, and opportunity that have been shaped by this history.

* CS educators key change agents in overcoming this history to imagine more diverse, equitable, and inclusive visions of CS education that were overlooked in history by the White, non-disabled men that shaped it.

It’s tempting to think of CS as ahistorical: computing is, after all, a discipline focused on inventing the future. We are used to new technologies becoming rapidly dated, discarding floppy disks for USB keys, USB keys for cloud storage, and cloud storage for whatever comes next. It is a discipline that often discards and forgets the past in favor of the next new thing. This culture of future-focused thinking can be enticing to apply to CS education as well, viewing teaching as needing to “keep up” with the latest innovations in technology and CS education pedagogy, quickly forgetting what came before.

Of course, we ignore history at our peril. History is crucial for understanding why and how we teach CS. Not only does history help us understand the ideas in CS education that have been tried in the past, but even more importantly, it helps us understand the forces that shape CS educators’ communities, values, and daily work, including the methods we use, the reform efforts we support, and the rationales that drive what we choose to teach and what we choose to ignore. This book, therefore, will engage CS education history to set this stage, before embarking on a journey through foundational ideas in CS and CS education. And throughout, we will use the history of CS to situate the changes that have occurred throughout the short history of CS, both to help you as an educator understand the ideas in the discipline, but also to help you help students see that CS could have been very different than it is, and still can be.

# Early CS Education as Calculation

Long before CS was an academic discipline, and long before anyone advocated that students learn about CS, the ideas in computing were subtly woven through human civilization in the form of *calculation*. Early calculation was done on the earliest of computers, the abacus, a device used as early as 1900 BC in Mesopotamia and China to tally and count quantities without numbers<menninger13>. To use an abacus, one had to learn how it encoded quantities and supported manual arithmetic; and to design improvements to abaci, one had to understand the abstract processes of counting that abaci built upon. These ideas about calculation co-evolved with the invention of numbers in India around the 8th century<ifrah00>, where traders in marketplaces needed more compact ways of encoding and calculating large quantities for large trades. Abaci were relatively slow and hard to learn, whereas number systems could quickly encode large quantities with a few symbols, and perform arithmetic on those symbols to compute sums and differences (e.g., 25 chickens - 12 chickens = 13 chickens). This Hindu number system found its way to Baghdad in the 9th century through the Arabic book, _On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals_, where scholar Al-Khwārizmī adapted the Hindu system into the Arabic number system we use today (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). This Arabic number system then proliferated throughout the West in the 12-century through the Latin translation of the _Hindu Numerals_<smith13>, as well as through _Liber Abaci_<sigler03>, Fibonacci’s 1202 book on Arab numerals. This Latin translation, titled _Algoritmi de numero Indorum_, was also the first known use of the word algorithm, a central idea in CS.

Embedded in this history of calculation, number systems, and computing, were the earliest forms of CS education. For example, when children apprenticed to learn a trade, they were taught how to use abaci, numbers, and arithmetic to compute. As ideas of calculation spread throughout the world, the need to educate youth about how to use these systems to participate in trade expanded<bjarnadóttir14>. As these ideas became foundational to mathematics in the highest reaches of colleges and universities throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, their practical applications began to become clear, and a new profession emerged: the *computer*<grier01>. The earliest known use of this word was in 1613 in a book titled _The Yong Mans Gleanings_ by English writer Richard Braithwait. The term, at the time, did not refer to calculation machines like the abacus at all, but people who took on the task of quickly performing arithmetic and algebraic calculations. In fact, that use of the word continued until the 1940’s, when, at the time, most computers were women, because they could be paid less than their male counterparts<light99>. Learning to become a “computer,” then, meant learning to swiftly and accurately perform mathematical calculations, just like modern computers do.

Since the invention of numbers and calculation, teaching arithmetic has long been considered essential to education, including in Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, ancient Egypt, and the broader classical education in medieval Europe. Thus, when public education emerged in the United States in the 19th century, and industrialization increased demand for basic numeracy skills to participate in trade, democratizing the skills of calculation was a goal<klein03>. Counting, calculation, and arithmetic became critical skills, just as they were thousands of years prior in Asia and the Middle East. To the extent that we view CS as the discipline concerned with how to calculate, and CS education as about teaching people how to calculate, CS education has been part of education across the world for millennia in the form of arithmetic.

# Computers Professionalize and Industrialize CS Education

While calculation coevolved with mathematics, the 19th century brought new ideas about the nature of computing. As we shall discuss in later chapters, inventors and mathematicians such as Charles Babbage<hyman85> (1791-1871) and his protege Ada Lovelace<essinger14> (1815-1852) began to imagine devices called “differencing machines” that would go beyond pure calculation to include more elaborate algorithmic procedures that could analyze and process not just numbers, but any information. Babbage was driven by the goal of automating the work of human computers, allowing businesses to replace the many people employed as computers with much faster, modern versions of the abacus; Lovelace was driven by the beauty of mathematics and numbers. Others built on the visions and ideas of Babbage and Lovelace:, Alan Turing<hodges14> (1912-1954), inspired by Lovelace’s writings, theorized about computation and its limits; Claude Shannon<soni17> (1916-2001), theorized about how to represent information as binary values of 1 and 0. These new theories inspired thousands of engineers and researchers in the 20th century across universities to realize the vision of the “differencing machine” in digital terms.

All of this progress was fundamentally fueled by education, often grounded in mathematics and engineering, but focused on the problem of automating calculation and algorithms. For example, the first digital computers in the 1950’s served to solve problems of war, replacing the women who calculated missile trajectories in minutes with digital computers that could do the same in seconds. But the first people to learn to program digital computers were women--especially Black women with degrees in mathematics, since they could be paid even less than White women<shetterly16>--exchanging their role in speedy manual arithmetic for the role of carefully writing and debugging instructions for mainframes. CS education in these times of war was math education, the instruction manual, and other women engaged in peer learning and teaching<fritz96>.

It quickly became clear that digital computers could be transformative. Universities and industry research labs, which had been the origin of many of the innovations necessary to create digital computers, began to invest in CS education. The low-wage pathways for women to jobs as human computers—majoring in mathematics and working in science and industry—disappeared, replaced by new pathways that focused on White men in higher education. For example, one of the first CS departments was at the University of Cambridge; it began its first degree program in 1953, founded by a White man, with an all White male faculty, teaching primarily White male students. The same happened with the first CS department in the United States at Purdue University, which was founded 1962 by a White man, who hired an all White male faculty and taught mostly White men. These first programs, which graduated the doctoral students who became faculty at many of the other universities founding CS departments, established the early conditions for the lack of diversity in CS education, shifting CS education from something informal amongst women mathematicians, to something only accessible to students at elite institutions.

As higher education created these privileged pathways to CS education, industry began to recruit from them. Early efforts at IBM, one of the first major companies to sell digital computers, struggled to recruit because of the lack of higher education graduates, created training programs of their own to educate people about how to build and program digital computers. Some of these programs even created pathways for Black employees at IBM to become certified technicians, though IBM saved the senior positions and management opportunities for White men<mcilwain19>. Higher education eventually caught up with the industry demand, displacing these training programs. The resulting structure—higher education educates students about computer science, and industry hires them—is the one we live with today.

As academic CS emerged in higher education, meetings amongst CS faculty formalized, and the [Association for Computing Machinery|https://www.acm.org] (ACM) emerged<doyle15>. This professional society sought to organize, support, and advocate for the research and practice of CS internationally. Originally, it was open to all who were interested; in 1966, it adopted grades of membership and membership fees, and constituted rules around the creation of “special interest groups” (SIGs), to organize members into interest areas. As most of the members were faculty at colleges and universities, and digital computers were new, CS education was of central interest to its members. The result was that the very first ACM SIG was the Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE). It first met in 1968, then formalized its SIG, and has held an annual conference every year since to discuss and share advances in CS education. Of course, since it was founded by faculty in higher education, and ideas from CS were largely absent in primary and secondary education, its dominant focus for many decades was higher education CS. And since the primary contributors were White men engaged in CS research, and who lacked any training in education or education research, most of the contributions to the conference were practical in nature, sharing valuable tips, techniques, tools, and experiences about CS teaching.

# Attention Turns to Primary and Secondary School

As CS education in higher education matured, some computer scientists began to turn their attention to primary and secondary education. For example, Seymour Papert (1928–2016), a mathematics Ph.D. and computer scientist at MIT, had worked with developmental psychologist Jean Piaget (1896–1980) for five years at the University of Geneva. Piaget had contributed the _constructivist_ theory of learning, which viewed learners as creating new knowledge from prior knowledge, motivated primarily by interest and curiosity. Piaget’s ideas transformed education in Europe and the United States to be more child-centered. Papert, who was Piaget’s protogé, built upon these ideas with his own _constructionist_ theory of learning, which argued that learners don’t just build upon prior knowledge, but they build knowledge in their own unique ways, rediscovering the powerful ideas from the past that are deeply situated and personal. He reimagined schools as places that would support students’ following individual paths in this knowledge construction, viewing teachers as facilitators in these personal journeys, rather than authority figures managing homogenous, industrialized experiences. In his book _Mindstorms_<papert93>, he famously positioned digital computers, and computer programming, as being particularly suited to supporting children’s unique intellectual journeys because it allowed for a kind of personal expression in intellectual domains that afforded tinkering, experimentation, and immediate feedback. He described computers as enabling children to “debug” their mental models of the world through code.

Papert’s ideas inspired many educators to bring computers into the classroom throughout the 1980’s. But many educators only superficially engaged Papert’s ideas, simplifying them to “learning through making” or “learning with technology”; many creative and engaging efforts by teachers were also hard to assess, because the children’s unique learning trajectories were so divergent. As teachers’ narrow conceptions of constructionism and public school’s commitment to industrialized models of teaching failed to transform education the way Papert had envisioned, interest in computers in the classroom waned. 

As Papert’s ideas were shaping teachers’ efforts, software companies like Apple, IBM, and Microsoft further reduced Papert’s ideas into capitalist goals of getting computers into the classroom throughout the 1990’s. These visions imagined that simply by placing computers in school, learning would happen automatically, without any structure or guidance. This same basic narrative of computers as a path to liberation spread far beyond the United States, with many influential CS leaders attempting to spread computers to the global south, and largely failing, as there was once again no vision for how the computer would be used<ames19>. While CS education in post-secondary was growing and shaping a powerful new industry, CS education in K-12 schools was ultimately conflated with education technology (using computers to learn) and digital literacy (learning to use computers). Thus, the modern ideas of CS, while shaping government, business, and higher education across the world throughout the 20th century, failed to shape primary and secondary education. 

The result of these failed education reform efforts throughout the 1980’s and 90’s were that only a select few were encouraged into CS education. Computer and video game companies marketed to White boys<kiesler85>; White boys like Bill Gates<becraft14> and Paul Allen got privileged access to computer labs via their private high schools; and movies like [War Games|https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/] portrayed White boys as isolated nerds who were rewarded for breaking rules. While these Western ideas shaped the youth in North America and Europe who pursued CS education in higher education, the rapid growth in economic opportunity generated interest throughout Asia, creating interest amongst wealthy Indian and Chinese boys who could attend universities in the United States and Europe. These global economic and cultural trends further reinforced the lack of diversity in CS at all levels, creating an almost exclusively higher education system of White and Asian boys.

# A Second Attempt at K-12 CS Education Reform

The lack of gender and ethnic diversity in CS education became so notable that reform efforts reemerged in the 2000’s. This time, however, they were centered in ideas of broadening participation rather than ideas of reforming education in entirety. Notably, [Dr. Jan Cuny|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janice_E._Cuny], a professor who had long advocated for broadened participation in computing, left the University of Oregon to join the U.S. [National Science Foundation|http://nsf.gov], where she founded the [Broadening Participation in Computing|https://www.nsf.gov/cise/bpc/] grant program. NSF’s commitment to funding research and implementation on broadening participation efforts was transformative. Funding led researchers to focus their attention on barriers to CS education and methods for engaging youth in learning CS. Basic research funding for computing education research led faculty to shift their attention to foundational questions in learning and teaching CS. This funding supported books like _Unlocking the Clubhouse_<margolis03>, which analyzed structural barriers to women studying CS at Carnegie Mellon University. It funded projects like “Out of the Loop,” which studied why so few Black, Latinx, and female students were learning computer science at the high school level in three Los Angeles public schools, resulting in the book _Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing_<margolis10>. It also funded the [Exploring Computer Science|http://www.exploringcs.org] curriculum, one of the first CS curricula and teacher professional development efforts grounded in research.

These early efforts to study diversity in CS education catalyzed an entire ecosystem of interconnected efforts. Computer scientist Jeanette Wing, who had led the part of NSF that funded CS research, advocated for literacy of computer science ideas for all people, under the phrase computational thinking. CS Teachers Association (CSTA) was founded, dedicated to serving primary and secondary CS educators in ways that ACM SIGCSE had not. Several efforts to standardize learning outcomes emerged, ultimately being unified in the K-12 CS Standards that are widely adopted across the United States and other countries, influencing the focus of CS teacher education and professional development, and ultimately what youth learn about CS in schools. Philanthropists like Brad Smith of Microsoft funded not-for-profits like Code.org, which has sought to influence K-12 CS education policy across the United States, and develop curriculum and teacher professional development to grow the country’s capacity for CS teaching. NSF’s funding, and the thousands of researchers, teachers, and activists whose work it supported, therefore catalyzed national and global attention on CS education in schools.

% TODO There might be opportunities here to elaborate on the cultural factors that shape these different motivations.

As with any education reform effort, there are many competing ideas about why CS should (or even should not) be taught to youth:

* Some view teaching CS as a way of opening career opportunities to youth, helping youth secure economic independence and stability. This is a byproduct of the high demand for CS knowledge and low supply, which creates high salaries, but is also sometimes linked to economic racial justice.

* Some view teaching CS as another path to creative expression, linking it to Papert’s ideas of constructionism, and the notion that computers are an ideal medium in which to explore, simulate, and understand the world.

* Some view teaching CS as a way to bring technology into schools, ensuring that all youth have exposure to our increasingly digital world, even if they live in places and communities where technology is less visible.

* Some view teaching CS as a way to increase the number of competent software developers for industry. This is an inherently neoliberal view, positioning the purpose of education as serving industry.

* Some view teaching CS as a way of developing the computing literacy necessary for engaged citizenship in an increasingly digital world. These motivations stem from a view that making informed choices about technology policy (e.g., what responsibilities software companies have, what digital privacy rights should individuals have) requires understanding CS. 

* Some view teaching CS as a way to counter the ways in which computing is used to encode and amplify bias, harm, oppression, and injustice. This motivation frames CS education as a political effort.

These many different values and motives, while all leading to similar goals of broadened participation, vary in their implementation. Reform efforts driven by capitalism tend not to be concerned with who learns, as long as they are learning well and can serve industry. Reform efforts driven by empowerment tend to be more concerned with developing youth identity and self-efficacy and less with particular skills or ideas from CS. Reform efforts driven by justice tend to be driven by action and activism in communities, both using computing, and with the goal of reforming computing. All of these different motives interact with the motives behind other intersecting subject areas; for example, there are similar reform efforts to diversify science, engineering, and math. 

Alongside these many different motivations for general CS education are the Career and Technical Education (CTE) pathways that have long been part of public education in the United States. These pathways, which are more explicitly defined as career pathways that link directly to industry, more typically intersect with business, marketing, and the trades. Many schools frame CTE pathways as preparing students for jobs immediately out of high school, placing CS alongside trades like manufacturing, construction, and other careers that do not require a college degree. Most K-12 CS education still resides in CTE, creating tensions within schools about who “owns” CS, as well as tensions with higher education and industry, which broadly view CS as something strongly benefitting from a college degree<guzdial16>. These tensions have created further tensions in CS teacher certification, creating often artificial and unhelpful distinctions between “CTE endorsed” CS teachers, and “CS endorsed” CS teachers.

All of these competing ideas about CS education rest upon a history of public education that has chronically underserved, disregarded, and marginalized groups at the bottom of various nations’ social hierarchies. In the United States, Black, Hispanic, and Native American students and students with disabilities are least likely to have access to CS education and least likely to engage in it when they do<google20>. Most CS teachers are White men and women. And economic and cultural trends, such as how CS is portrayed in the media and what economic opportunities a child has in their country, all result in significant disparities in participation, and a significant shortage of CS educators to serve all schools. At the heart of all of these differences are the same systems of oppression around race, gender, ability, and class, that have long shaped who has power. And now that knowledge of CS is such a clear source of power, access to that knowledge about CS is contested.

-

Looking back on the thousands of years of calculation, computing, computers, and CS education, we can see that our history is a particular one. It is one born of war and commerce, one that sought to replace people with machines, but also one that emerged from a love for the beauty of mathematics, procedures, and information. The CS education we have built so far has inherited this history, along with the many other histories of oppression embedded into our cultures, laws, and values. And as with any education reform effort, it is rich with political conflict, competing visions, unequal resources, and varying knowledge and opportunity. Our particular history of CS education has produced a particular world of computing, one that might have been different had voices other than White, cis, non-disabled men been at the table.

CS educators work amidst the outcomes of this history, its ideas, and its constraints, but also get to bring new voices to the table. Learning standards influence what CS teachers teach, but they are also something teachers can resist. What resources exist to support CS education are largely shaped by economic and political forces, but CS teachers get to participate in shaping those forces. Whether CS educators stay in the profession is shaped by the salary differentials of industry, but also by how CS teachers organize to demand competitive salaries. And while most youth globally remain deeply enamored by technology and its uses, CS teachers can help youth develop a critical consciousness of how computing is reinforcing and amplifying the longstanding social hierarchies and inequities that shape their lives. In the rest of this book, we will examine the ideas in CS that have so powerfully overtaken these social structures, and prepare you to help students see them, analyze them, and reimagine them.
