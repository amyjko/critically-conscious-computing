# Criticially Conscious Computing: Methods for Secondary Education

This book is a collaborative effort at the University of Washington to create materials for pre-service secondary CS educators. This book is still in draft form and not hosted anywhere. It's built with [Peruse](https://github.com/amyjko/peruse), a simple framework for authoring online books.
