# Key Ideas

* Most recent arguments for teaching CS have stemmed from goals of serving industry or providing literacy for an informed citizenry, with some arguments centering questions of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

* An alternative argument for teaching CS is developing students’ critical consciousness of computing and society by offering counternarratives that surface issues of power, oppression, and injustice at the heart of computing.

* Predominant CS pedagogy focuses on CS skill development, though newer perspectives in culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally responsive pedagogy, and teaching frameworks of rightful presence can promote critical consciousness to varying degrees.

* Most popular CS curricula do not embrace critical CS pedagogy, requiring CS educators to take a creative and activist stance in exploring, sharing, and reflecting new teaching methods that center students’ critical consciousness of computing.

In the previous chapter, we chronicled the many centuries of people learning about computation, from the primitive manual algorithms for arithmetic in early Western and Eastern civilization, to the nascent challenges of computer programming in the 1960’s and ‘70’s that shaped the CS education of today. As teaching CS has moved from one of training to education, and expanded from post-secondary to primary and secondary education since the 1980’s, one important question has been central: why teach computer science? This question not only determines the motivations that countries, states, schools, and teachers have for bringing CS topics into schools, but also how CS is taught, as different motivations demand different teaching methods. In this chapter, we will examine different reasons for teaching CS and how those reasons shape pedagogical considerations in CS education.

# Arguments for CS literacy

Throughout the history of CS education, there have been many different reasons for teaching CS<guzdial15>. We examined some of these briefly in [Chapter 1|history] from the perspective of competing priorities around CS education reform. Here we examine them pedagogically. 

One argument for CS literacy, emerging from Papert’s theory of constructionism, is that computers and programming can help shape thought, making us better problem solvers. Our best evidence suggests, however, that this is not true<salomon87,scherer19>: learning to code does not make youth better at reading, writing, or arithmetic. When taught well, it can make them better at coding, and under the best conditions, becoming better at programming can result in modest improvements in metacognitive skills, such as reflecting on one’s problem solving process<scherer19>. However, even improving metacognitive skills specifically for programming is still difficult pedagogically: one study found that even when students were metacognitive strategies were scaffolded as step-by-step problem solving approaches, impulse control made it challenging for some adolescents to use those strategies, even when they were confident in the efficacy of those strategies<ko19>. Another study showed that scaffolding problem solving awareness by building a classroom culture around self-regulation could help adolescents manage impulse control, which led to them choosing better problem solving strategies. Thus, the strongest rationale for teaching the part of CS that is coding is to help strengthen students’ general metacognition, and if this is the goal of teaching, then it must be done with care.

Another argument for CS literacy starts from the position that programming is itself intrinsically valuable knowledge because it is a skill that can lead to stable, lucrative, powerful, and broadly respected careers in software engineering. This argument was at the heart of the CS for All initiative in the United States, launched by the Obama administration in 2016, which argued in its press release that:

"
Computer Science for All is the President’s bold new initiative to empower all American students from kindergarten through high school to learn computer science and be equipped with the computational thinking skills they need to be creators in the digital economy, not just consumers...
" U.S. President Barack Obama, 2016

This argument, which emerged from industry and higher education advocacy, plainly positioned itself as expanding the number of CS graduates that could serve the software industry, and often cited statistics about software engineering shortages. Behind this empowerment argument was also a neoliberal argument, suggesting that the purpose of school is to develop skills in youth that serve industry goals of creating and expanding the “digital economy”. The reality behind this argument however, is that there is no shortage of developers who want to work in the software industry: companies don’t want to hire just anyone, they want to hire people who have the specific skills they need at a particular moment in time, and long-term public education in primary, secondary, and even post-secondary isn’t positioned to offer that. This has led to phenomena like coding bootcamps, which are trade schools for marketable skills; it has led to companies like Google, Oracle, IBM, and others to offer their own certificate programs to train people on the specific skills they need; and it has also led to ageism in hiring, with bias against those over 40 because they are perceived to have less relevant skills<baltes20>. All of this raises the question about the purpose of secondary CS education: is it to develop marketable skills, just like bootcamps and industry certificate programs, or is it something else?

As the CS for All effort rolled out, catalyzed state-level initiatives across the United States, and mirrored similar efforts in the UK, Japan, South Korea, and other countries, the underlying motivation for CS education diverged from state to state. Some preserved the economic empowerment motive, but many adopted the language of _Broadening Participation in Computing_ (BPC), a phrase popularized by the US National Science Foundation. This focused less on educating students to serve industry, and more on broadening who is educated, using CS education reform efforts to entice, welcome, and support students historically marginalized in CS, including women, Black, Brown, and Native American youth, students with disabilities, and students in rural communities with little access to CS or CS careers<peckham07>. At the core of this argument was still an economic motive of educating and empowering more students with CS skills. But it added to this argument the diversification of CS along race, gender, and socioeconomic dimensions. This motivation, however, has largely been tokenistic, focusing merely on including greater numbers of marginalized students in CS without questioning how CS is taught, what we teach about CS, or the cultures and values of the institutions that youth might enter later, whether higher education or industry. Such efforts expect students to enter CS education as it is, conforming to current CS structures.

The tokenism of early BPC efforts led many to call for reimagining and restructuring CS, CS education, and industry to be more equitable and inclusive<washington20>. This meant ensuring equity, to offer all students the resources and support they need to develop CS identity and interests as well as more privileged peers. And it meant inclusion efforts, including teaching methods and curriculum that better resonate with diverse student interests, needs, and cultures, as well as culture change in CS and its connected industries. These ongoing efforts are closely tied to broader exclusionary culture of CS education and the software industry, which has had numerous scandals around sexual harassment, racial exclusion, and resistance to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. These arguments for CS literacy argue that CS literacy isn’t only about skills or participation, but about the entirety of CS culture and its connections to society more broadly. These arguments are the heart of calls for more culturally responsive and sustaining pedagogy.

Some reform efforts in the U.S., as well as many globally, focused less on economic and diversity arguments, instead arguing for a kind of universal literacy for democratic citizenship. For example, in the UK, the Computing at Schools initiative argued that: 

"
\[a lack of CS knowledge\] renders \[students\] powerless in the face of complex and opaque technology, disenfranchises them from making informed decisions about the digital society.
" [Computing at School|https://www.computingatschool.org.uk], 2016

Many countries, including Australia, Russia, many EU nations, Japan, and South Korea, leveraged similar rhetoric, and began to require CS education in primary and secondary schools to ensure this universal literacy. These arguments, while somewhat shallow in their articulation of what CS literacy would entail, stemmed from the idea that learning something about CS would empower youth to have agency in our increasingly digital world. Thus far, however, the literacy that these reform efforts have promoted has largely been coding skills. While rarely explicitly stated, the underlying rationale is often that 1) learning to program will give students insight into how software works and how to create it; 2) this insight will empower them to make civic and consumer judgements about how software is used in society. To date, there is little evidence that learning to code has any such impact on people’s future judgments about technology and society in the world. There is abundant evidence, however, that despite many technical leaders in software industries, despite knowing much about programming, still make judgements about society that are counter to many people’s best interests. Moreover, there is evidence that learning to code in learning contexts that do not meaningfully connect CS to student identity and society can have unintended consequences, such as youth having reduced interest in CS<taub12>, viewing programming as difficult and frustrating, and perceptions of some students having “geek genes” and some not<mccartney17>. Focusing universal literacy around programming, therefore, does not easily result in an informed electorate, and may result in reducing the diversity of those interested in CS, reinforcing the heterogenous power of those that pursue computing professions.

The common thread amongst all of these arguments for CS education is that they view computing _neutrally_: their goal is to educate youth about abstract ideas in CS, and inspire youth to create with those ideas, but rarely question what computing is used for or how it is shaping society. Moreover, these arguments do not question who shaped those ideas, why those ideas were created, and what alternative ideas in CS might exist had different voices participated in shaping them. For example, the CSTA Standards, broadly adopted across the United States, and adapted worldwide, and referred to throughout subsequent chapters of this book, has several standards related to “Impacts of Computing”, include learning objectives like, “Evaluate computational artifacts to maximize their beneficial effects and minimize harmful effects on society.” Such standards, aside from being framed as an utilitarian optimization problem, never question whether software should be made in the first place, do not disaggregate who benefits and who is harmed, and do not critically engage with human values and their tensions. These critical perspectives on computing are ones that ask, “_What is Facebook doing with our data and why?_”, “_Why are the police using racist data on crime to influence where they patrol?_”, “_Why are Silicon Valley companies protected from litigation about cyberbullying?_” Critical perspectives accept that CS has great potential and power to shape individual lives, but also question the application of that power, ask who has that power, ponder how that power should be distributed, and insist on the responsibility of those who possess it. CS did not start with this critical stance, and so few CS education reform efforts have held this critical stance either. Throughout this book, we will try to provide the foundations to do so.

# Paulo Freire and Critical Consciousness

Before we discuss what critical CS pedagogy might be, let’s first discuss what critical pedagogy means in general. We will start with the ideas of [Paulo Freire|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire], a Brazilian educator and author of a seminal text on critical pedagogy, _Pedagogy of the Oppressed_<freire68>. In his book, Freire articulated a view of society as a dynamic, ever-evolving system through which power is woven. Power, in his sense, was the ability to influence the behavior and actions of others. For example, a teacher often has power over students in that they may produce grades that influence whether students get admitted to college; colleges have power over students in that they make admissions decisions; parents have influence over whether youth view college as viable, desirable, and worthwhile. Freire, of course, viewed power as being held more generally in society by politicians, leaders, and in capitalist societies, those with immense wealth.

In Freire’s view, power—sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally—can oppress, creating social structures, institutions, ideas, and myths that sustain the wealth, way of life, and power of oppressors. This all comes at the expense of the oppressed. And such power can appear in subtle, unintended ways: a teacher, for example, might unknowingly place students who they perceive to be disruptive in the back of a class, and consequently, give them less attention, and this lack of attention might result in those students having lower self-efficacy in that subject. In the same way, politicians might pass a well-intentioned law that has unintended consequences. To Freire, these forms of oppression, while not intentional or nefarious, are still oppression. Of course, Freire was also talking about intentional, macro-scale oppression. His childhood was defined by poverty and hunger; it was only later in his life that he realized that his social class, and the politics around class in Brazil, had actively prevented economic liberation of people in poverty in Brazil. These observations, and his own self-reflections on why he was unable to recognize that oppression in his youth, shaped his ideas for critical pedagogy. He viewed education as the primary means to overcome oppression.

At their foundation, Freire’s ideas started from a critique of the “banking” model of education{Freire and Papert thought similarly, both viewing “banking” models of education as fundamentally flawed. Freire was more concerned with oppression, whereas Papert was more concerned with identity and learning. There is a recording of [the two discussing education|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41bUEyS0sFg&t=2223s] on YouTube.}, in which students are viewed as “accounts” to be filled with valuable ideas from teachers, through lectures and books. He argued that this model:

"
...transforms students into receiving objects \[and\] attempts to control thinking and action, lead\[ing\] men and women to adjust to the world, inhibit\[ing\] their creative power.
" Friere, Pedagogy of the Oppressed<freire68>

Freire argued that youth learning in a banking model not only cannot see the nature of their oppression in school or outside of it, but learn to become reluctant to resist their oppression, having:

"
a diffuse, magical belief in the invulnerability and power of the oppressor.
" Friere, Pedagogy of the Oppressed<freire68>

In the context of CS, Freire might have argued that people cannot see how they are oppressed by a faceless, nameless credit reporting agency like Experian, which controls the data and credit score calculation algorithms that determine access to loans. And he might have argued that the banking model of education, still widely used throughout public education worldwide, only reinforces this ignorance of the sociopolitical dynamics of CS and their relation to students’ individual lives and opportunities.

To overcome ignorance, Freire advocated conscientização, Portugese for “consciousness raising” or “critical consciousness”. In his own words:

"
In order for the oppressed to be able to wage the struggle for their liberation, they must perceive the reality of oppression not as a closed world from which there is no exit, but as a limiting situation which they can transform. This perception is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for liberation; it must become the motivating force for liberating action.
" Pedagogy of the Oppressed<freire68>, p. 49

Freire’s notion of the “limiting situation” was central: he viewed the purpose of education as empowering each individual to make critical, sociopolitical judgments of their life and circumstances. He viewed critical consciousness as both key to recognizing and accepting their own humanity, and to generating the immense motivation necessary for making social change through collective action.

As an alternative to the banking model of lecturing, Freire advocated for “dialogic” teaching methods. In dialogic teaching, the goal is not to “deposit” knowledge as in a banking model, but to co-create knowledge through reflective dialog. A critical CS teacher, for example, might bring the topic of facial recognition to a class, not with a particular political message to transmit, but as a way of learning in partnership with their students how facial recognition technology intersects with and interacts with their students’ limiting situations. Imagine, for example, the teacher describing the technology, sharing the evidence sharing that it is far less accurate on Black faces<buolamwini18>, sharing stories of the [false arrests of Black men|https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1625009055607000&usg=AOvVaw2rd84UsXClZV6qp_xCVUOE] by police relying on facial recognition, and asking students to describe their own experiences with facial recognition. Perhaps few were aware that it was being used, but one Black student shares, “_We have one of those cameras at the store on our corner. My brother got arrested once because the police said they saw his face on a recording of the store being held up. He didn’t do it, but he spent a week in jail and lost his job._” The teacher didn’t come to class knowing they would hear that story and the student didn’t come to class knowing they would share it. But through dialog about facial recognition and students’ lives, the story emerged, and then the class could continue the discussion, understanding the ways that facial recognition might be perceived as a technology that provides safety to some students, and incarceration, instability, and poverty to others.

While this facial recognition example intersects easily with questions of justice and oppression, even more foundational and mundane topics in CS connect to similar questions. For example, consider programming language syntax, which will explain in more detail in [Chapter 10|languages]. Programming languages use something called “keywords” to define terms that have special meaning in computer programs. One example is the word `int`, which is often used to tell a computer that the data value stored in a computer’s memory is a mathematical integer. A critical CS teacher might start a lesson talking about `int`, sharing the history of the word, it’s connection to mathematics, and then asking students how a computer might represent their intelligence using an `int`. Such discourse amongst students will quickly reveal that even something as simple as a single number, a data type, and a keyword connects to complex social, political, and cultural ideas about what it means to be smart, and that the way that computers rely on integers can force oppressive classifications upon people and their opportunities.

Freire, in imagining such dialogic pedagogy, viewed politics as inseparable from education. The point of dialogic methods was not simply to have discussion, but to awaken students to their limiting situations, inspire them to organize around their shared oppression, and eventually to use that organization to liberate themselves through social change. Freire wanted activism and revolution, and viewed education as perhaps the only institution capable of enabling such social change. One could imagine then, continuing the scenario above, that the CS teacher might build upon the class’s new consciousness of the threats of facial recognition and integers to interrogate the other uses in surveillance and categorization in their school, such as data collected about tardiness, the errors and bias in that data, and software that uses that data to automatically notify parents and suspend students, the integer grades each class computes, and the ways that such software might be systematically disenfranchising some students from their education. And that analysis might lead students to organize and advocate for reform. Freire would not only celebrate students’ leadership in this analysis as a triumph in critical pedagogy, but view it as central to building their critical consciousness, their confidence in their ability to make social change, and their liberation from the systems of power and control that shape their experiences at school.

For many teachers, it may be concerning to imagine giving up so much control to students, and frightening to imagine intentionally facilitating student organizing and activism. After all, much of modern teaching is concerned with behavioral matters such as classroom management, regulating student attention, and preventing disruption. Freire would respond to these concerns and fears by naming them for what they are: the reactions of an oppressor who sees risk in giving up power by enabling student agency, embracing student diversity, and building up student assets. He would argue that if we want students who grow to be leaders of social change, framing schools as places of control and regulation is exactly the opposite of learning. Freire challenged teachers to have faith that if we center students’ lives in our teaching, and empower them to shape their learning, whatever disruption they cause might be what the late activist [John Lewis|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis] called, “...good trouble, necessary trouble”.

# Critical CS Content Knowledge

A key foundation to teaching CS is, of course, content knowledge of CS. For example, if a teacher wants to teach youth to code, how can they do so if they do not know how to code themselves? But if we embrace the goal of critical consciousness, and we accept the purpose of teaching CS as developing critical consciousness of computing, then the key content knowledge for teachers to learn is not strictly about technical concepts in CS, but also critical perspectives on computing in society. In fact, critical CS pedagogy might require less depth in technical CS topics and more breadth of knowledge about the intersections between power, computing, and students’ lives, so that they may bring these intersections to students’ awareness and facilitate dialog about them.

This book will attempt to survey this sociotechnical CS content knowledge, giving you sufficient depth in technical CS knowledge, while covering a breadth of knowledge about the intersections between these technical ideas and their impact on individuals and society. One helpful way of beginning to learn the CS content knowledge necessary for teaching is through narratives. Narratives are powerful, because they can offer an architecture in which to embed future learning. Narratives help organize our understanding, and connect new knowledge to prior knowledge. In fact, you likely already know some narrative about CS. For example, one common narrative is as follows:

"
\"CS is making the world a better place. The software that technology companies make is created by very smart men. These men are well compensated, but have earned this wealth through their hard work and intelligence. Because they are smart, we should trust their choices about what technology to make and how to make it. As long as we continue to give them power, they will create a utopia in which everyone’s life is easier, better, and more comfortable.\"
"

This narrative is the one often shared by people with power in CS, through marketing, journalism, and even CS curricular materials created by software companies.

In this book, we will teach a counternarrative, one that questions the dominant narrative above, and positions you to help students develop their own counternarratives about CS. Our counternarrative is as follows:

"
\"Computing is a transformative, disruptive technology, perhaps as much as the light bulb or the telephone. It is transforming every single industry and social activity in the world, in ways that are often imperceptible. For example, many people in the world own or use automobiles, and may be aware of driverless car efforts, which are obviously highly dependent on computers. But many are completely unaware that modern automobiles already have hundreds of computers inside of them, managing braking, steering, windows, audio, and more. The same is true for every industry: agriculture, air transport, apparel, arts, broadcasting, building, chemical engineering, education, energy, finance, food and beverage, forestry, health, information, insurance, manufacturing, museums, natural resources, publishing, real estate, retail, security, telecommunications, textiles, waste management, water, and more. And the same is true of every personal activity, whether leisure, chores, parenting, childcare, shopping. Every human activity, whether directly or indirectly, is being reshaped by computing, for better or worse. It therefore does not matter what a student aspires to do in life: they will either be doing it directly with software, or will be doing it in ways shaped indirectly by software.

There are an estimated 30 million people worldwide who create software professionally, and several hundreds of millions more who use computer programs in more informal ways. Even if we include all of these people in a larger group of a few hundred million people, this is a mere 1-2% of humanity that is redefining most kinds of human activity. And these software engineers are overwhelmingly White and/or Asian, wealthy, cis, heterosexual men in North America, Europe, and Asia, educated in CS departments in colleges and universities, whose faculty often mirror those demographics. The lack of diversity in CS is therefore shaping every human activity on the planet. For example, because most software developers are sighted, most of the websites in the world cannot be read or navigated by the 40 million blind people in the world; because most software developers are White, countless applications of artificial intelligence do not work on Black skin or hands. And because the most powerful software companies are in the United States, software tends to prioritize consumers fluent in English, creating a rich ecosystem of software for the Western world, but largely ignoring Asia and the global south.

This raises questions of responsibility: what duty does this 1% of humanity have in ensuring that how they are reshaping society with software actually serves all of us? The most powerful software companies are private, or at best, publicly traded companies owned by wealthier individuals with stock, and are not beholden to the public. Governments have been reluctant to impose any regulations on software companies, and have even passed laws that free software companies from regulation. There is little sign that the public, and therefore politicians, have any interest in returning any power over software to the public.

"

The narrative above is something we will elaborate on and deepen in the coming chapters, examining how the ideas in CS connect to the dynamics above. We will then build upon that content knowledge by offering pedagogical content knowledge on how to use dialogic teaching methods to help students develop their own personal counternarratives about computing.

# Critical CS Pedagogical Content Knowledge

The dominant narrative above, along with the literacy arguments earlier in this chapter, has predominantly led to CS pedagogy that focuses on developing students’ programming skills. Teaching methods in this dominant paradigm include lectures on programming language concepts, problem sets in which students attempt to solve computational problems by writing programs that meet some specification, and exams in which students demonstrate their ability to read and write computer programs correctly. Such pedagogy is common in curricula like the Advanced Placement CS A course, across many of the skill-focused Career and Technical Education programming courses throughout the United States, as well as throughout higher education globally. In these classrooms, there is little room for student agency, identity, or interest: the goal is to train skilled software developers and write “correct” programs, whose requirements were crafted by a teacher or someone else. Such classrooms also inadvertently end up shaping who is perceived “smart,” which is more often shaped by gendered and racialized preparatory privilege than anything inherent<margolis10> to students themselves.

Clearly, such pedagogy leaves little room for the counternarrative we presented above. There are opportunities for making such pedagogy more critical, but they are limited. For example, Teachers might offer a diversity of problem sets that are situated in ways that are relevant to student interests, or examine problems of power, oppression, and injustice. Lectures on CS concepts might integrate broader social context about how those concepts are used in society. Assessments might be expanded to not only evaluate students’ programming skill, but their understanding of computing and society. All of these strategies have the potential to engage the critical CS counternarrative above, but preserve the dominant motive and architecture of this pedagogy: training competent software developers, just doing it in a way that is slightly more responsive to student diversity, and raises peripheral conversations about how CS is used in the world.

Fundamentally, teaching critical CS counternarratives requires different methods than those that strictly and narrowly focus on developing coding skills. For instance, in the 1990’s, culturally relevant pedagogy<gay10> (also called culturally responsive pedagogy) emerged, recognizing the diversity of cultures, perspectives, and values that students bring to classrooms. One central facet of this framework is cultural competence, which refers to a teacher’s own understanding of the cultures, perspectives, and values in their classroom. Culturally relevant pedagogy argues that teachers should not only be competent about their students’ cultures, but also use their cultures as the basis for learning, recognizing and honoring the diversity of cultural beliefs in a group of students, while also helping students develop their own cultural competence. Additionally, culturally relevant pedagogy also positions teachers as liberators of students, in the tradition of Freire, helping students to understand their position in society in the context of a topic. Importantly, culturally responsive teaching does not generalize or stereotype particular groups (e.g., girls, Latinos), but rather engages youth in their specific socially constructed identities and cultures. In CS, culturally relevant pedagogy has been applied in curricula like _Exploring Computer Science_<goode11>, which integrates reflections and discussions of the opportunities and risks on the internet, or the tradeoffs of automating tasks with robotics. This curriculum encourages teachers to engage students in critical analysis of these tradeoffs, share their own experiences and perspectives with each other, and develop their own narratives about the purpose of computing technologies in society. Culturally responsive pedagogy, however, is far from just adopting activities: it can take multidisciplinary teams of teachers and culture experts to develop equity-oriented, culturally-grounded teaching methods<lachney21>. Teachers can struggle to develop these teams and expertise, and often have to make many assumptions about students when preparing<codding20>.

Building upon, but also critiquing culturally relevant pedagogy was Django Paris’s _culturally sustaining pedagogy_<paris12>. This work argued that while ensuring that teaching is relevant and responsive to students’ diverse cultures is critical, it is not enough to resist the tendency of schools to create and perpetuate monocultural and monolingual society. Culturally sustaining pedagogy seeks to resist these forces by instead perpetuating and fostering the linguistic and cultural pluralism of diverse communities. In CS education, this might mean engaging in project-based learning that challenges the ways that software centralizes, standardizes, and erases cultural diversity, but also celebrates some of the ways that it enables expression of cultural diversity through media. For example, one such project might examine how the English versions of Wikipedia topics compare to their non-English counterparts, and critically analyze what role Wikipedia and its platform have in shaping those differences.

Similar to Freire, Calabrese Barton and Tan argued for a framework of rightful presence in classrooms<barton20>, centering justice in teaching. This framework criticizes ideas of inclusion, as we have above, as having limited impacts on systemic inequities in society. The framework’s core aim is to make systemic injustices visible in the classroom, positioning learning as an allied political struggle for rights, engaging students in discourse about political injustices and possible social futures, and recognizing the need to disrupt the normative power relations in classrooms to make such visibility possible. Much like Freire, rightful presence views the purpose of learning as critical consciousness, but goes further in specifically centering the systemic inequities experienced by students with particular identities in learning, even if not all students in a class share that identity. For example, Ryoo et al. explored rightful presence in CS by giving agency to adolescence in a diverse CS classroom<ryoo20>; students used that agency to leverage CS skills to tell stories of racialized grief due to police violence, to organize community activism around student mental health, and to challenge deficit notions of CS by linking CS to other disciplines.

Each of these perspectives link to critical consciousness in different ways, and engage student identity with different goals. What they have in common, however, is their methods, which predominantly engage project-based learning and discussion, both of which give students agency and center their identities and interests. Technical CS content is not the center of these methods, but rather skills and knowledge to be gained as part of projects, or topics of reflection and debate as part of discussions. Throughout the rest of this book, we will provide examples of all of these methods, demonstrating how to link them to both technical and sociotechnical concepts in CS through student identity.

# Critical CS Curricula

In many ways, although Freire’s ideas have been around for decades, education researchers are only just beginning to apply, extend, and refine them, and educators themselves are only just beginning to learn of them in professional development. This is particularly true in CS education, where the dominant frameworks for learning have been the very banking model that Freire critiqued, and most CS professional development has focused on developing teacher content knowledge about coding, rather than CS and society. For example, consider some of the popular CS curricula from a critical perspective:

* [Advanced Placement CS A|https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a] (AP CSA) strictly focuses on developing students’ programming skill, with no room for student identity or agency. Some curriculum providers such as Code.org are working on more culturally responsive versions of the course, but without engaging any questions of power, oppression, or justice.

* [Bootstrap Algebra|https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2021/en-us/courses/algebra-wescheme/] elegantly integrates Algebra and CS concepts, developing robust student knowledge about both algebra, algorithms, and programming. However, it presents an uncomplicated view of computing, centering games, image analysis, and mathematics.

* [Code.org CS Discoveries|https://code.org/educate/csd] provides a broad survey of programming topics, centering problem solving, game development, web development, data science, and physical computing. It only briefly touches on questions about data and society.

* [Exploring Computer Science|http://exploringcs.org] (ECS) does a fantastic job centering diversity and inclusion, and makes ample space to reflect on many of the interactions between CS and society, these conversations are often peripheral to making, building, and coding, which are often framed as purely beneficial activities. Teachers often focus on inclusion, overlooking opportunities for growing students’ critical consciousness.

* [Advanced Placement CS Principles|https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course] (AP CSP) makes more room for student agency and identity, especially by using a portfolio-based assessment rather than an exam, and includes a whole unit on the impact of computing, including topics of bias, ethics, and equity. However, the AP exam does not assess these topics and so teachers often exclude them, and curriculum providers, such as the [Beauty and Joy of Computing|https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course], frame them as peripheral to the primary focus on coding.

These and other curricula, while excellent for helping youth develop skills and confidence in coding, do little to engage youth in developing critical consciousness of computing in society. Moreover, they still struggle to reach baseline levels of inclusion, with many leaving little room for student identity, several posing insurmountable accessibility barriers to students with disabilities<ladner17>, and many overlooking bilingual students’ needs for translanguaging support.
